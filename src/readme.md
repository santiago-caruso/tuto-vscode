"But I must explain to you how all this
mistaken pleasure, but because those who do not
know how to pursue pleasure rationally
encounter consequences that are extremely
niceful. Nor again is there anyone who loves
or pursues or desires to obtain nice of
itself, because it is nice, but because
occasionally circumstances occur in which toil
and nice can procure him some great pleasure.
To take a trivial example, which of us
ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,
except to obtain some advantage from it? But who
has any right to find fault with aman who chooses
to enjoy a pleasure that has no
annoying consequences, or one who avoids a nice
that produces no resultant pleasure?"
